# discord-webhooks

Discord webhooks is a simple client for Discord's webhook API.

### Motivation

While this is probably "yet another" library for Discord's webhook system, I wanted to make my own. Discord doesn't support BitBucket's webhook system and the Slack compatible endpoint doesn't send a message.

## Getting Started

You can either copy the PHP file directly into your project or _preferable_ just use composer.

#### Composer require command
`composer require nopjmp/discord-webhooks`

## Usage

It is fairly easy to use. I'll throw in an example.

```php
use \DiscordWebhooks\Client;
use \DiscordWebhooks\Embed;

$webhook = new Client('DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL');
$embed = new Embed();

$embed->description('This is an embed');

$webhook->name('Bot')->message('Hello, Human!')->embed($embed)->send();
```

Sending Files:
```php
use \DiscordWebhooks\Client;
use \DiscordWebhooks\File;

$webhook = new Client('DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL');

$webhook->username('Spammer')->message("Hello world")->file(new File("FILE URL (NOT ABSOLUTE)", "FILE NAME OF YOUR DREAMS"))->send();


```
